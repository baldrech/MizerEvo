# MizerEvo
Instructions:
open "main.r"
run "setting things up" section (line ~20)
install packages that do not load

everything is run from the main.r script
after "setting things up" there is a "multiple runs" comment (line 42)
le loop below is an example of a run. Just change "path_to_save" to where you want to save.
everything below this is just work in progress

to check all the parameters go to myModel.r
obs: the canibalism parameters now determine the value in the whole interaction matrix, not just the diagonal.
the different plots are in plotFunction.r but not well explained

good luck!
